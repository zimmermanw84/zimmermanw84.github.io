        Welcome back to my blog, great to have you back! This post is going to be about a major problem facing the tech world, net neutrality. I spent some time doing research on this and there are a few layers to this topic. One, and the biggest issue for me, is the "big broadband" companies being able to manipulate your data. The second is charging more for a faster service, and slowing connection speed of less expensive services.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we will start with the manipulation of data. Personally, this feels like a breach of your first amendment rights of freedom of speech. I have a link to the ACLU's web site that discuses this that  will post below. This site says that the "big broadband" companies have already had a few incidents where they have blocked or censored internet streams of broadcast that didn't match views of said company. Peal Jam was streaming a concert on AT&T's network and sang, "George Bush, leave this world alone". Those words were never heard by a live internet audience. AT&T claimed that there was an issue with the website company that was streaming the concert. Seems to me like blaming a website is a good PR scapegoat. This denied viewers of, in my opinion, peaceful political protest by Pearl Jam. If you like Bush or not that is obviously not the point. It's Pear Jam's 1st amendment right of freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say. The words we're not vulgar or obscene so there was no point for censorship, unless of course you believe that those words got muted because of another website's mistake...

      </p>
      <p>
        This is only the tip of the iceberg, and only one of a few "incidents" that the ACLU reported on. What's gonna happen if the FCC losses all ability to maintain net neutrality? The "big broadband" companies will be able to block websites all together that don't align with their agenda and/or a threat to their livelihood. This is very contradictory of American ideals; Land of the free? That doesn't sound very free to me if companies can't limit or restrict "freedom" of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second side to this is companies can limit or boost internet speed or data transfer speed depending how much the customer pays. I don't necessarily have a major gripe with this aspect of it. Obviously, I don't want to pay more for internet service. I do feel though, that companies have the right to price their products at whatever price they deem fair. I think the free market economy will take car of that. Assuming that all the companies aren't in cahoots with each other to monopolize the pricing.

      </p>
      <p>
        The major part of this is maintaining civil liberties and our first amendment rights. There is no reason that a private company should be able to restrict what you want to post on the internet. Regardless of the content, everyone is entitled to their opinion. It's the American way.
