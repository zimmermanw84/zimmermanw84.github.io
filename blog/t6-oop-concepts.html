        Welcome back to my blog! In this weeks installment I am going to be comparing Object Oriented(OO) and Functional programming. Some consider the two styles of programming to be opposites.. I would have to agree for the most part. In OO everything is an object, and each object has its own behavioral traits programmed into it. Functional is more about functions, "Oh no way".. Yea not very descriptive huh, we'll let's get into it.

      </p>

      <p>
        We will start with OO, mainly because I have a better understanding of it. When designing an OO program it's all about keeping it simple. First, I'll start by saying that EVERYTHING is an object. Making your program run basically is just objects sending messages to each other. Depending on what messages you send will result in the behavior of your object.

      </p>
        In functional programming it's more about the predictability of the program and it being non-destructive. Non-destructive in the sense that it's not changing or modifying values. Also know as "Side effects". The roots of functional programming are in Lambda calculus, it provides the theoretical framework for describing functions and their evaluation. It seems to me like this type of programming would be used in data analytics rather than program development.

      <p>
        In conclusion each language has their application proposes. If I had a choice between the two the answer would have to be... It depends on what I am trying to accomplish. I have a friend that is working for a data analytics firm and they made him learn R; a functional programming language. His company has a specific need to analyze lots of numerical data so they use a functional programing. On the other hand, if you had to design a video game or a program that stores information you might go with OO programing. Thinking conceptually that you might need the program to be more flexible with user input. Giving these objects behavior and having them interact with each other might be the way you want to go.

      </p>
      <p>
        This may not have been the most informative blog about these concepts, so if you're interested do some research of your own! Here are some links that might shine a brighter light on the subject.
