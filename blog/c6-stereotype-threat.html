        Welcome back to my blog. I'm pretty sure no one is reading it by now, but if you are thanks. This installment is on the stereotype threat. There were a few sources I used for research on this topic and by far the best one was a lecture by Claude Steele at Columbia University. Links will be posed below. The results of some of his experiments really blew my mind so if you have time I really recommend that video. Anyway, the stereo type threat. Basically it's the threat of being reduced to a stereotype.

        Imagine this... You are an awesome math student, and you have a math test coming up. The only problem is that you are a woman, and you were told that women do terrible on this test. So you take it and you do terrible. Now you already had pre-affirmed reason why you did terrible. Effectively placing the blame on the identity rather then the individual. It makes it very easy to justify why you did so terrible. What before the test they told you that women typically get the same scores as men? As you probably guessed, the women do significantly better.

        The power of suggestion seems paramount here. If you think about it, society, our whole life has been suggestive. It's all about what social group you identify with. When put in a stressful or difficult situation it's natural for us to identify with whatever social group we feel fit the situation contextually. Claude Steele mad several awesome points pertaining to this type of situation. So seeing suggestive things all around our society is also shaping individuals to act like the identity.

        It seems to work both ways. If the relevant group that you identify with contextually does poorly in said situation then the individual will more than likely underperform and meet standard set by the identity. If you take away the threat of being a stereotype, also not having your identity to  blame if you come up short, you get more individual based results.

        I know this is a lot easier said than done, but I think of Rene' Descartes... "I think, therefore I am(or exist)". I think this a good way to think about it. Rather than identifying with a social group try to channel yourself in stressful situations. Not having an excuse or a reason you acted a certain way. It's a new day in age and it's terrible to fall back on old stereotypes. Hopefully this good was food for thought. Check this video out!!
