        Welcome back to my blog. In this installment I am going to be talking my personal values and the stereotype threat. How the two relate is pretty simple. Whenever you start feeling like you are being stereotyped, and instead of defaulting to that stereotype identity, take a look at your values and apply them. Taking a more individual approach rather then an association with a group. Above there are four values that I picked from a list which I feel apply directly to my core beliefs.

      </p>

      <p>
        All of these are 5 out of 5 in my book, but the one that I feel applies to me the most lately is meaningful work. I am choosing that one because that last seven years I have done nothing of the sort. Dealing poker was anything but meaningful work. I've felt so much better lately with the DBC work that I've been completing. Giving me a purpose, seeking understanding is way more rewarding than dealing cards to gamblers.

        The last piece of advice I gave was to my sister. She's been going through a tough time with her son's father. They have a hard time seeing eye to eye on anything. She's in a position where she wants to completely move on with her life and but because of having a child with a less than adequate mate, to say the least, she unable to do so at this time. I just told her that she can't worry about he is saying about her, which are all lies to sound good in court, and trust that the truth will prevail. She has ample evidence to defend her self, she just hates that it has to come to this... But thats life, if you make bad choices you pay for them eventually. You just have to keep putting one foot in front of the other, and continue on doing the right thing.

        Let's get back to values and the stereotype threat. I think that if you are cognizant of anything you can affect the  outcome. So if you are aware that you are defaulting to a stereotype identity and you think to yourself, "That's really not me.", then think of you core values and stay true to them. I feel like i've been wrongly stereotyped and completely surprised people buy not falling into that category. Then other times I've defaulted to the group that I identify with that conflicts with my core beliefs. I have tattoos, scruff, and muscles. I come somewhat of a rough background and I've been on both sides of the tracks, so to speak. I've been wrongly judged in situations where people thought I was stupid or even a criminal, and proved them wrong. However, when I default to my stereotype, I think to myself that "Why should I have to prove to these people otherwise". So I either confirm their prejudice, situationally, or ignore it completely.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think in any situation where you are feeling down you have to take an objective look at yourself. Are you identifying with a social group or stereotype? Or are you being true to your values. It's tough sometimes, but remaining true to your self and to your values, you will make it.
