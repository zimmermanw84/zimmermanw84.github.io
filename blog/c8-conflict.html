        Hello and welcome back to my blog. In this episode we are going to be talking about conflict. This is something that we all deal with, some more than others... I would say that I have had my fair share of conflict in my life. I can thank the casino business for that. I've been that target of and the witness of many instances of conflict but the one that stands out is one where a customer called me a liar, and told my boss they should fire me...

      </p>

      <p>
        So it started with this customer using excess profanity and speaking in another language. My job as a poker dealer is to enforce rules set by the house, swearing and speaking in other languages is not appropriate. So I make an attempt to enforce the rules. I told the customer politely, "Please watch your language and english only please..". He ignored me.. So I asked him again the next time, again he ignores me. So I call the floor man (my boss). I explained the situation to him and the customer started screaming at me. Calling me a lier and tells my boss that he should fire me due to my inability to tell the truth. My boss, who was not great at his job, told the customer that he would "handle it".

      </p>

      <p>
        In my previous industry there are a lot of terrible people. That's a pretty broad statement, but it's pretty accurate. It's totally over run with degenerate gamblers, also known as addicts that encompass all the same attributes of drug addicts. Number one rule is that the floor man should have your back. In this situation the floor should have defused the situation and stayed professional and neutral. Instead, by saying that he would handle it assumes fault on my part. At this point there were a few things going through my mind. But the overwhelming emotion that I felt was anger.

      </p>

      <p>
        I take my job very serious and being a professional very serious. When I was accused of being a liar and then my boss backing the customer up brought anger out of me. At this specific time I did not have the resolve to just let it go. My boss waked away and I continued dealing my game. The customer started digging at me, asking me why would I lie? Am I racist? ect.. So being a young man full of pride and a reputation to protect (an illusion, no such thing in the poker biz), I decided to tel this guy exactly what I thought. I won't go into great detail but I ended up getting sent home.

      </p>

      <p>
        Later in my career I was faced with similar situations and had this experience to draw upon. This type of thing happens more frequently than you would think. In an industry where people lie so much they believe their own lies compounded by them loosing money.. You really see the nasty side of people. Thus learning, you can't control what other people do nor let it get to you. There is something to be said for being the bigger man. In the first situation I let my pride/anger get to me. Had I just let it go, no matter what was being said by the boss or customer. I now know that reacting out of anger is never the right answer and these days it takes a lot to get a rise out of me.
