        Well.. Let me start off by welcoming you back to my blog. This blog is going to be mainly a self refection of my thinking style and how I can apply that knowledge to my DBC experience. My personal learning style is Abstract Sequential, from the Gregorc thinking test. I must say, I think he's on to something. I'll post the link below, but the category I fell into basically describes me to a 'T'.
      </p>

      <p>
        So far in DBC theres been two main struggles for me. The first one is that I have no formal education other than High School, which I wasn't exactly a valedictorian. So sometimes the little things are difficult to me, like spelling. It's kinda embarrassing but I keep a google window open in the back just so I can spell check words when writing in markdown. The second is learning by sitting and reading a book. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy reading, but I hit a threshold. I get to a point where I am not absorbing anymore information. Before I took the Gregorc test I thought it was because I have little experience learning that way. The test told me that I learn better actually doing what I learn in a simulated environment. That makes a whole lot of sense to me. I have been breaking up the reading by keeping the IRB open in the command line so I can actually see things in action. That helps me immensely, and builds confidence in my ability to learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Theres two side to every coin. With the positive things I learned about my learning style, there are also things that I need to be mindful from during DBC. There are several things on the list of "What's hard for (me)" that hit the nail on the head. The one that stood out to me was "Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly". Im pretty sure that sentence sums up the entire DBC experience in a nut shell. So I have to be mindful that I already a have a pre-disposition to stressing my-self out in the pressure cooker that is DBC. I just have to be able to recognize it, take a deep breath, and carry on. Lucky for me I have an amazing wife, who is a DBC graduate, that can help me accomplish serenity when I need it the most.

      </p>
      <p>
        Now I have to apply the growth mindset into the equation. Just because some test says I'm this or I'm that, doesn't mean that I don't have control over my own universe (actions). Any deficiencies that I have related to a pre-disposition can be curved by being aware of it then working towards improvement. The brain is a powerful thing, and anything is possible with hard work. You can even change the way your brain thinks. So with time, any affliction or obstacle can be overcame, as long as you're willing to do so.
