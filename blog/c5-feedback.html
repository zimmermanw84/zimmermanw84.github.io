        Hey! Welcome back to my blog, I appreciate you taking the time to read it. This post is going to be about feedback. During the DBC experience feedback becomes a way of life. Giving and receiving feedback is an intricate part of the learning experience. So much of what you do as a developer is going to be under the microscope so you better be prepared to receive positive and negative feedback.

      </p>

      <p>
        I find that writing feedback that is kind, actionable, and specific; is a lot harder then it sounds. Because these people are my peers and I will be getting extremely close to them over the next few months I find it difficult to say negative things about them initially. This is all apart of the process. How will you know you are making a mistake if no one tells you? That's why DBC uses the A.S.K. (Actionable, Kind, and Specific) acronym. Initially I thought feedback was a negative thing but it's really all about feedback. It's were all the growth happens. By being A.S.K. your not putting anyone down, you're helping them grow as a programmer.

      </p>

      <p>
        Over all I think the pairing aspect of DBC is where I learn the most. Because there are two views and perspectives of the challenge, and in ruby there are a plethora of ways to solve the problem, this is where the learning happens. Bouncing ideas off of each other, talking the problem out, trying and failing then overcoming adversity together. My peer programing experience has been overwhelmingly good, also to my surprise.

      </p>


      <p>
        When receiving feedback you have to take it for what it's worth. Put it in perspective and if it's negative, learn from it. If you don't agree with it then take it with a grain of salt but try and remain objective. Not everyone is their best everyday. So look at your self honestly... It's helps to have another set of eyes look at you while you work. Like I said previously, it's all about growth and without feedback there will be no growth.
