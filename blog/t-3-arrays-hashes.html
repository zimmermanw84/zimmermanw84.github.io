        Hello there! Welcome back to my blog, I hope you are back because you learned something on the previous posts... This weeks post is on Arrays and Hashes. So here goes my non technical explanation, they both store stuff. Thats it.. all you need to know.. Just kidding, but thats really not far off from the truth. Im putting most of the technical syntax at the bottom, feel free to look it over.
      </p>

      <p>
        So there you are in ruby 'gets'ing information and all that cool stuff...  and now you have a problem. What do you do with that info? Looks like you need a place to store said information. Let's put that information in a array! An array is basically a box of ordered information. The first place in an array is numbered 0 then 1, 2, 3 and so on. Just remember if an array is a street, zero is the first address on the street.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now a hash is very similar to an array in the fact that they both store information. However, if a hash was a street it would have no address. Hashes are un ordered boxes of information retrievable with a key. Imagine a hash is the dry cleaners, no ticky no laundry (sorry had to, hehe)... In a hash, there are two things being stored; a key and a value. Instead of retrieving data from an array with an address (0 or 1 or wherever it's located), every value you want to retrieve has a key. Give your ticket to the hash and get your laundry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mind you these are all very non technical explanations. Obviously this can get very 'Neo in the matrix' once you start getting into arrays within hashes or vice versa... or arrays in arrays and hashes in hashes and so forth. But thats the very basic idea.
      </p>
      <h4>Make an Array!</h4>
      <p>These are a few examples how to create an array. There are more mind you...</p>
      <code>ary = Array.new >>> []</code>
      <code>Array.new(3) >>> [nil,nil,nil]</code>
      <code>Array.new(3, true) >>> [true,true,true]</code>
      <code>ary = []</code>
      <h4>Make an Hash!</h4>
      <p>These are a couple examples how to create a hash. There are more mind you... (this is a hash rocket! =>  )</p>
      <code>hash = { "key" => "value", "key2" => "value2"}</code>
      <code>Hash.new() >>> {}</code>
      <code></code>
      <p>Thanks for reading my blog!!
