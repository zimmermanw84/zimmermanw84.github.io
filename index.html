          <h1>Asking Good Questions?</h1>
          <p>Wednesday, January 7th, 2015</p>
        </div>
      </a>

      <div class="blog_main">
        <p>
          How do you ask a good question? Why, that’s a good question… Asking good questions is a very important part of the learning process. This is especially true in DBC. So much of the “Kitchen” philosophy depends on asking questions and taking responsibility for your own education (If unfamiliar, read blog below on Kitchen V. Table). We all grew up being told that there is no such thing as a dumb question, that may not be necessarily true. Making sure you ask the question correctly will help ensure that you will get the answer you’re looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          First off read your question. Seems obvious right? If you read your question and don’t understand it; then how would some else? Im sure everyone has done this before. Sometimes it takes a lot to finally ask a question. By the time you do, your mind is so wrapped up in the problem that you ask a question that has no context.  Context is so important when you ask a question, you have to paint the picture for the person to fully grasp the situation. Set the stage! Explain everything that is relevant to answering the question: Program Language, Version, OS etc..
        </p>
        <p>
          How should I ask good question. Notice I didn’t use a ‘?’… Make sure that you are actually asking a question. I am guilty of this. I start explaining the situation and say “I did this and it broke..”. So, yes it broke. What did you expect would happened? We’ll obviously not break, but when asking a question you need to do better then that. Get more factual and give an expectation, then ask “Why didn’t that meet expectations?”. If there are error messages throw that in with setting the stage, giving all possible information and expectations will help you get the answer you are looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, make a good impression. I know this may not seem like it has anything to do with actually asking the question. Which it doesn’t, however it has everything to do with you getting the answer you’re looking for. Making a good impression will help you get the audience you’re looking for. If your question looks terrible (i.e. Spelling, grammar, punctuation) then you might get a terrible answer. This is good practice for life. You have to play to your audience. If Einstein was scrolling down the page and saw your question and the presentation was sloppy and/or poorly worded; would he stop to read it? Maybe, but probably not. You would drastically improve your chances of someone with sufficient grey matter to answer your question (the way your looking for) if was clear and presented properly.

          <h1>NoSQL</h1>
          <p>Thursday, January 3rd, 2015</p>
        </div>
      </a>

      <div class="blog_main">
        <p>
        Welcome back to my blog! During this installment we're going to be discussing NoSQL databases (DBs). Here is a very helpful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHAItWE7QMU"><button>Video</button></a> that help me understand what NoSQL is. By looking at the name you would think that NoSQL is as it sounds, but it's actually "Not only SQL". This is another type of database management system.
      </p>

         <img src="http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah251/zimmermanw/e7c36a0b-a7a5-47b8-a0e6-ce74fdc3b925_zps750e0350.png" border="0" alt=" photo e7c36a0b-a7a5-47b8-a0e6-ce74fdc3b925_zps750e0350.png"/>

        <img src="http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah251/zimmermanw/402fb097-d48c-4306-baef-b843e657f44d_zps56ab1ed4.png" border="0" alt=" photo 402fb097-d48c-4306-baef-b843e657f44d_zps56ab1ed4.png"/>

      <p>
        So why would I not use a relational database?<br>
        One instance would be when you have a massive amount of data and want to maintain a level of performance. When using a relational DB it can get messy with many, many to many relationships. That doesn't bode well for performance, joining tables and making complex queries could really bog you down and slow the DB down. Also, what if the data is not structured? (Like this blog) You would probably go for a NoSQL type DB.

      </p>

      <img src="http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah251/zimmermanw/b3e90542-54a9-40d5-9bf3-0e545783026e_zpsdac8fa84.png" border="0" alt=" photo b3e90542-54a9-40d5-9bf3-0e545783026e_zpsdac8fa84.png"/>

      <p>
        Sounds great right? So when wouldn't I want to use one?<br>
        Well, whenever you need the DB to preform complex transactions would be one instance. Anytime you would be putting more pressure on the DB to preform tasks rather then just storing is probably when you would think about not using a NoSQL DB.
      </p>

      <img src="http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah251/zimmermanw/d0e23055-23f0-474c-ab68-26870ebcd226_zps1b8a60f8.png" border="0" alt=" photo d0e23055-23f0-474c-ab68-26870ebcd226_zps1b8a60f8.png"/>

      <p>
        In conclusion, if you need the DB to provide constraints and/or preform complex transactions you probably would not choose a NoSQL type data structure. However, if your primary focus is horizontal scalability and fast performance, then NoSQL is probably what you're looking for. I highly suggest you watch the video link above. It offers great insight into this subject. Thanks for reading!!

          <h1>Conflict</h1>
          <p>Thursday, January 1st, 2015</p>
        </div>
      </a>

      <div class="blog_main">
        <p>
        Hello and welcome back to my blog. In this episode we are going to be talking about conflict. This is something that we all deal with, some more than others... I would say that I have had my fair share of conflict in my life. I can thank the casino business for that. I've been that target of and the witness of many instances of conflict but the one that stands out is one where a customer called me a liar, and told my boss they should fire me...

      </p>

      <p>
        So it started with this customer using excess profanity and speaking in another language. My job as a poker dealer is to enforce rules set by the house, swearing and speaking in other languages is not appropriate. So I make an attempt to enforce the rules. I told the customer politely, "Please watch your language and english only please..". He ignored me.. So I asked him again the next time, again he ignores me. So I call the floor man (my boss). I explained the situation to him and the customer started screaming at me. Calling me a lier and tells my boss that he should fire me due to my inability to tell the truth. My boss, who was not great at his job, told the customer that he would "handle it".

      </p>

      <p>
        In my previous industry there are a lot of terrible people. That's a pretty broad statement, but it's pretty accurate. It's totally over run with degenerate gamblers, also known as addicts that encompass all the same attributes of drug addicts. Number one rule is that the floor man should have your back. In this situation the floor should have defused the situation and stayed professional and neutral. Instead, by saying that he would handle it assumes fault on my part. At this point there were a few things going through my mind. But the overwhelming emotion that I felt was anger.

      </p>

      <p>
        I take my job very serious and being a professional very serious. When I was accused of being a liar and then my boss backing the customer up brought anger out of me. At this specific time I did not have the resolve to just let it go. My boss waked away and I continued dealing my game. The customer started digging at me, asking me why would I lie? Am I racist? ect.. So being a young man full of pride and a reputation to protect (an illusion, no such thing in the poker biz), I decided to tell this guy exactly what I thought. I won't go into great detail but I ended up getting sent home.

      </p>

      <p>
        Later in my career I was faced with similar situations and had this experience to draw upon. This type of thing happens more frequently than you would think. In an industry where people lie so much they believe their own lies compounded by them loosing money.. You really see the nasty side of people. Thus, learning you can't control what other people do nor let it get to you. There is something to be said for being the bigger man. In the first situation I let my pride/anger get to me. Had I just let it go, no matter what was being said by the boss or customer. I now know that reacting out of anger is never the right answer and these days it takes a lot to get a rise out of me.

          <h1>The Stereotype Threat</h1>
          <p>Friday, December 5th, 2014</p>
        </div>
      </a>

      <div class="blog_main">
        <p id="blog">
        Welcome back to my blog. I'm pretty sure no one is reading it by now, but if you are thanks. This installment is on the stereotype threat. There were a few sources I used for research on this topic and by far the best one was a lecture by Claude Steele at Columbia University. Links will be posed below. The results of some of his experiments really blew my mind so if you have time I really recommend that video. Anyway, the stereo type threat. Basically it's the threat of being reduced to a stereotype.

      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine this... You are an awesome math student, and you have a math test coming up. The only problem is that you are a woman, and you were told that women do terrible on this test. So you take it and you do terrible. Now you already had pre-affirmed reason why you did terrible. Effectively placing the blame on the identity rather then the individual. It makes it very easy to justify why you did so terrible. What before the test they told you that women typically get the same scores as men? As you probably guessed, the women do significantly better.
      </p>


      <p>
        The power of suggestion seems paramount here. If you think about it, society, our whole life has been suggestive. It's all about what social group you identify with. When put in a stressful or difficult situation it's natural for us to identify with whatever social group we feel fit the situation contextually. Claude Steele mad several awesome points pertaining to this type of situation. So seeing suggestive things all around our society is also shaping individuals to act like the identity.

      </p>
      <p>
        It seems to work both ways. If the relevant group that you identify with contextually does poorly in said situation then the individual will more than likely underperform and meet standard set by the identity. If you take away the threat of being a stereotype, also not having your identity to  blame if you come up short, you get more individual based results.

      </p>

      <p>
        I know this is a lot easier said than done, but I think of Rene' Descartes... "I think, therefore I am(or exist)". I think this a good way to think about it. Rather than identifying with a social group try to channel yourself in stressful situations. Not having an excuse or a reason you acted a certain way. It's a new day in age and it's terrible to fall back on old stereotypes. Hopefully this good was food for thought. Check this video out!!

          <h1>Feedback</h1>
          <p>Sunday, November 30th, 2014</p>
        </div>
      </a>

      <div class="blog_main">
        <p>
        Hey! Welcome back to my blog, I appreciate you taking the time to read it. This post is going to be about feedback. During the DBC experience feedback becomes a way of life. Giving and receiving feedback is an intricate part of the learning experience. So much of what you do as a developer is going to be under the microscope so you better be prepared to receive positive and negative feedback.

      </p>

      <p>
        I find that writing feedback that is kind, actionable, and specific; is a lot harder then it sounds. Because these people are my peers and I will be getting extremely close to them over the next few months. I found it difficult to say negative things about them initially. This is all apart of the process. How will you know you are making a mistake if no one tells you? That's why DBC uses the A.S.K. (Actionable, Kind, and Specific) acronym. Initially I thought feedback was a negative thing but it's really all about feedback. It's were all the growth happens. By being A.S.K. your not putting anyone down, you're helping them grow as a programmer.

      </p>

      <p>
        Over all I think the pairing aspect of DBC is where I learn the most. Because there are two views and perspectives of the challenge, and in ruby there are a plethora of ways to solve the problem, this is where the learning happens. Bouncing ideas off of each other, talking the problem out, trying and failing then overcoming adversity together. My peer programing experience has been overwhelmingly good, also to my surprise.

      </p>


      <p>
        When receiving feedback you have to take it for what it's worth. Put it in perspective and if it's negative, learn from it. If you don't agree with it then take it with a grain of salt but try and remain objective. Not everyone is their best everyday. So look at your self honestly... It's helps to have another set of eyes look at you while you work. Like I said previously, it's all about growth and without feedback there will be no growth.

          <h1>The Class System</h1>
          <p>Saturday, November 29th, 2014</p>
        </div>
      </a>

      <div class="blog_main">
        <p>
        Welcome back to my blog! This post is going to be covering Class's, instance variables, and instance methods. Below is an example of a class being created and under the initialize method, an instance variable is created.
      </p>

      <img src="http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah251/zimmermanw/ScreenShot2014-11-29at22622PM_zps24e59067.png">

      <p>
        Above you see how a class is created in ruby. It's very similar to the creation of a standard method. Nested within the class of "House" you have an instance variable named address. You can tell the difference between regular variables and instance variables with the @ symbol. We have @address set to a string, under initialize. This means that anytime a new house object is created it will start with @address set to "123 First st.".

      </p>

      <img src="http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah251/zimmermanw/ScreenShot2014-11-29at22806PM_zps151af9ba.png">

      <p>
        So now we're are creating methods within the class. If you notice the interpolation in the string, we're using the instance variable. This is the reason why we would use an instance variable. If we set this variable for the class, we can call that variable through out all methods created within the class. This allows for a lot more versatility for your programs. Not having to set and create the same variable over and over again. Now here is the whole program.

      </p>

      <img src="http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah251/zimmermanw/ScreenShot2014-11-29at22825PM_zps117e2347.png">

      <p>
        Now if you look at the bottom it shows us creating a new House object called my_house. Then we are calling our class instance methods on my_house.
      </p>

      <img src="http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah251/zimmermanw/ScreenShot2014-11-29at22729PM_zpsfd6eb94f.png">

      <p>
        And there you have it. Us calling our methods on our my_house object gives us the output we expected.
      </p>

          <h1>Let Me Think About It?</h1>
          <p>Wednesday, November 12th, 2014</p>
        </div>
      </a>

      <div class="blog_main">
        <p>
        Well.. Let me start off by welcoming you back to my blog. This blog is going to be mainly a self refection of my thinking style and how I can apply that knowledge to my DBC experience. My personal learning style is Abstract Sequential, from the Gregorc thinking test. I must say, I think he's on to something. I'll post the link below, but the category I fell into basically describes me to a 'T'.
      </p>

      <p>
        So far in DBC theres been two main struggles for me. The first one is that I have no formal education other than High School, which I wasn't exactly a valedictorian. So sometimes the little things are difficult to me, like spelling. It's kinda embarrassing but I keep a google window open in the back just so I can spell check words when writing in markdown. The second is learning by sitting and reading a book. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy reading, but I hit a threshold. I get to a point where I am not absorbing anymore information. Before I took the Gregorc test I thought it was because I have little experience learning that way. The test told me that I learn better actually doing what I learn in a simulated environment. That makes a whole lot of sense to me. I have been breaking up the reading by keeping the IRB open in the command line so I can actually see things in action. That helps me immensely, and builds confidence in my ability to learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Theres two side to every coin. With the positive things I learned about my learning style, there are also things that I need to be mindful from during DBC. There are several things on the list of "What's hard for (me)" that hit the nail on the head. The one that stood out to me was "Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly". Im pretty sure that sentence sums up the entire DBC experience in a nut shell. So I have to be mindful that I already a have a pre-disposition to stressing my-self out in the pressure cooker that is DBC. I just have to be able to recognize it, take a deep breath, and carry on. Lucky for me I have an amazing wife, who is a DBC graduate, that can help me accomplish serenity when I need it the most.

      </p>
      <p>
        Now I have to apply the growth mindset into the equation. Just because some test says I'm this or I'm that, doesn't mean that I don't have control over my own universe (actions). Any deficiencies that I have related to a pre-disposition can be curved by being aware of it then working towards improvement. The brain is a powerful thing, and anything is possible with hard work. You can even change the way your brain thinks. So with time, any affliction or obstacle can be overcame, as long as you're willing to do so.

          <h1>Margin, Border, Padding: What's the difference?</h1>
          <p>Thursday, November 7th, 2014</p>
        </div>
      </a>
      <div class="blog_main">
          <p>The diagram below, I feel, gives a great visual representation of the differences between the three. But, let's start by explaining that all three are the blueprint of the object/element they describe. Giving values to these will do several things, but mainly, they will allow you to possition your element where ever you want it to be on the page and manipulate the content inside.
         </p>

         <p>Let's start with Margin. This is your main attribute that allows you to place your element on the page. Giving it a value of let's say, (margin-left: 50px;). That will move your object away from the left side of the screen by 50 pixels. Same can be said by all; left/right/top/bottom. If you give it a value of auto; (margin: auto;) It will give all attributes equal value.. Centering it in the page, in-between elements of course. Get it? Don't worry if you don't yet, once you start playing around with it, it starts making a lot more sense.. Now let's move on to border...</p>

         <p>Border is the space in between the margin and padding. Let's say you wanna make a button, you want to give it definition so it stands out from the rest of the page or container it's in. So a typical value for a border looks like this; (border: 2px solid black;). First giving it a size of 2 pixels, it can be whatever you'd like. The type of border is solid, can also be dashed and dotted(im sure there's more). And finally giving it a color of black, also can be any color you'd like. Adding a border is an awesome way of giving definition to your element, making it stand out from other thing on your page... And then there's the padding.</p>

         <p>Padding is the space between the actual content of your element and the border. Let's say you have a paragraph in your element and it's right up against your left border. You want to move it to the right without moving your border.. Then it's time to put some padding between them!.. So, the padding command would generally look the same as the margin command; (padding-left: 50px;). That would give you a 50 pixel padding between your border and the content in your element. Also, instead of using px(pixels), it's good to use percentages(10%). Just so it will adjust to the browser, 50px on my computer might not look like 50px on yours!</p>

          <p>Hello! Welcome to my first blog entry. This blog I am going to be touching on Shereef's Fireside chat and verious veiws on DBC's learning experience, environment, and the culture. Also, my own personal expectations of the program.</p>
          <p>I am lucky to have 2 sources that I can use to prepair myself for the Dev Bootcamp experience. The first one being the awesome vid with Shereef (Video <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">here</a>) and I have my wife, Chermaine Zimmerman. She graduated Dev Bootcamp a year ago and now is a Web Developer for Viggle in San Fransico. It's pretty awesome to have her with, both, first hand Dev bootcamp exp. and real world developer exp. to give me a wealth of perspective to draw from, in school and in life.</p>
          <p>I think the DBC experience is going to be awesome. The way Shereef talks about how the "Kitchen v. Table" compairison is spot on, I believe. The American public, us/him/everyone, expects to get feed information and then boom... "I know everything", "I'am the consumer", "I paid for it", "That's what I ordered" a carrer in Web dev...-- That's the Table mind-set. That's not really the mind-set you should have comming into DBC. You should take more of the Kitchen mind-set. You put your apron on and get down to buisness! Take more personal resposibility for your education. It's really gonna take work but hey, If it was easy everyone would do it.</p>
          <p>I almost feel the like the DBC culture was made specificly for me. I would say that im not a very academic person...(Laughing). I joined the US Army pretty much right out of High School and then took a job dealing poker. I never thought I would go back to school for various reasons. The main one being that how much time is invested and wasted. I don't feel like the current University system is taylored for optimal education (generally speaking), and specificly where that education can guarantee you a carrer that can support a family(although nothing in life can really guarantee you anything). I am all for DBC's total immursive process, where you are completely submerged into the lifestyle of a Web developer. You eat, breathe, and sleep coding. And, learn something functional, something you can actually use and support yourself and even a family with! What a concept... A carrer where you can suport yourself financially..</p>
          <p>I will definiatly say that I am nervous about this experience. However, great changes in life have to be made outside your confort zone or no change will happen at all. A saying from my old profession (Poker Dealer)"No Gamble No Future!". You have to be able to take a chance in life to be successfull. And you can't let anxiety/nervousness get in the way of your future.</p>
          <p>I will say, that after watching Shereef's vid, it has made me want to be a chef in the kitchen of programming. I am inspired to put my apron on and get to work!</p>
          <p>Thanks for reading my blog!!</p>
