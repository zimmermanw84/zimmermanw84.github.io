      Well baybay... This years' letter comes to you from the digital realm. I figured that would be appropriate sense it's where we reside most of the time these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love you. BOOM. I say I love you and I feel it in my chest, or better yet my soul. I can't imagine life without you baybay. Everyday I wake up and look into your eyes, you give me a reason to be a better man. This love that we have is truly the things that Disney movies are made of. Things that nothing else in life can truly be compared to. Not even Chewy's love for bacon can compare.
    </p>

      I never thought that anyone as amazing as you existed in the Universe. Even though quantum mechanics states that someone like you must be out there... So even after I accept that you were obviously created, then; what are the odds that we would find each other? Those odds can't be great... Actually, so astronomically low that only one thing can explain. That we are truly "Meant to be" baybay. Both of our completely separate and different lives were brought together because we are meant to spend the rest of our amazing lives together.

    </p>
    <p>
      I am the luckiest guy in the world, actually in all the Universe. One day when we're old we can sit down and write a story about our life together. We will sell that story to a movie producer that will make the next generation "Notebook" (Laughing), and we'll make billions. Back to reality, I would never sell out our love by the way... I never imagined that I would end up with someone like you baybay. You are the most special person in my life.
    </p>

    <h3>
      You are truly, the love of my life baybay...
