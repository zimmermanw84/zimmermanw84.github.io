There are not accurate enough words to describe how I feel about you. [object Object] we have what everyone wishes they had in a relationship(Ok, I'll avoid the elitist route lol). As I look at you, right now actually, my heart melts. You are going to be the most amazing mother to young Bailey Z. I have now idea how I got so lucky to wake up next to you each morning. This year was a tough one, however it ends with great joy. A true test of a relationship is how we fair during the hard times, and I think it's safe to say that 'We're good'. We've been tested, dare I say battle hardened in the heart of the storm and it's about damn time. I feel that 2016 will be our best year yet, with the pending birth of the master race ```__proto__```. I am ecstatic just thinking about the possibilities and events that our time together has yet to unfold. You are my everything baybay ```<romantic music playing>```, we are blessed to have each other. But I will say it's over for us... Now it's all about Bailey!  

Forever,
