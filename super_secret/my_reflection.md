## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup  Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find a  ny resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Starting and cloning your own github repo is easy, even if your not techically savvy. First you go to the github web site and creat an account. Then simply click the button create repository. Boom, you're half way there. Make sure you click the "Initialize this repository with a README". This will allow you to git clone the repo immediately. Then go to the terminal "Oh no the terminal!"... Don't worry its not as scary as it sounds, only a few commands are needed to clone your repo. Now go to the directory you want it cloned to... Type: cd [filename]. If you don't have one simpliy make one by typing: md my_repos
This will create the directory needed then cd or change directory to the new directory you made: cd my_repos - hit enter... Then, got to your repo and copy the link in the bottem corner of your screen. Make sure it's the HTTPS version of the url (I'll explain the SSH version at in a later lession lol). Copy the HTTPS link and go back to the terminal. Then type: git clone [paste link here]. After you paste the link you're done. Congrats you did it all by your self :)

Open source is free software/code that is open to the public for distribution or modification however you see fit.
I feel like open source is a necessary part of developing software. I don't think it makes me nervous yet but I have yet to develope anything worth sharing with the masses, so my fellings might just be ingnorance.
It's very important to use licenses. Controlling or lack of controlling the distibution of your product. It's a huge part of the buisness side of developing. Say your developing an open source prodject. Someone get a hold the code, free from you. Then that person can sell that code but if they are selling it for money they have to tell the person they are selling it to that is an open source (General public license). So that person can't make a living of something you want out there for free.
I don't believe I had any one "aha" moment. It was more of a gradual development of understanding. The more I actually operate and interact with git and Github the more I understand whats happening and how the whole process works. At first I struggled with the git push origin master command. I thought that origin (for whatever reason) was origin on my computer. But after futher work with the remotes I feel like have a better understanding of the whole process.
